# Usage

Populate your config file with a working Google Sheets API key and the path to
your Neon White save. It's probably like this:
`C:\Users\user\AppData\LocalLow\Little Flag Software, LLC\Neon
White\<steamid>\savedata.dat`

Then you can run:
`$ nwscores compare`
![nwscores command running](docs/nwscores.png)

If the sheet ever changes URL or WR positions you can update them in the config
without rebuilding but no changes needed for now
